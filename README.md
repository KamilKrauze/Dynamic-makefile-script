# Dynamic-makefile-script
It is a shell script for the creation of a makefile.

run command in terminal as:

bash ./createMake.sh <optional argument>

<optional argument> - gcc, or g++      i.e  -  bash ./createMake.sh gcc

This will create a makefile that will support GCC or G++ compilation depending on which you have chosen.

Optionally you could do sudo chmod 777 createMake.sh in the terminal or the other distro equivalent of that so you could do instead

./createMake.sh <optional argument>
