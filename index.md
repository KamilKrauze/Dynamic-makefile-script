## The Bash Script

This is a bash script that basically writes an entire makefile for you for the GCC or G++ compiler. You only require to run the script inside of the terminal of your linux distro.

#### **NOTE: ** This script has been written and tested in Ubuntu OS, I do not know if it will run properly on other distros.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown


`$ bash ./createMake.sh <optional argument>`

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KamilKrauze/Dynamic-makefile-script/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
